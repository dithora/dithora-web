## How to run locally?

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

- Clone the repo:

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/dithora/dithora-web.git
  ```
If you don't have Git installed or you don't like using the terminal then you can download the [zip](https://github.com/dithora/dithora-web/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract that and open the extracted folder in the code editor of your your choice.
